1. Print the prime numbers between 1 and 100.
    - Write a program that uses nested loops (for or while).
    - The outer loop should iterate through every number from 2 to 100.
    - The inner loop should check if the current number is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
    - If a number is found to be prime (it has no divisors other than 1 and itself), print it.

2. Write a program that iterates through the numbers from 1 to 20 using a for loop. Inside the loop, use the continue statement to skip any odd numbers. Calculate and print the sum of only the even numbers encountered.

3. Write a program that asks the user for a size N (eg., 5) and prints a hollow square of stars with side length N.

Example for N = 5:
